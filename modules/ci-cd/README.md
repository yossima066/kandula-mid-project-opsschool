# Session 3 - Homework

* Full details in the Class's presentation and video.

## What we know:
* We learned how to integrate with GitHub - to edit our code, push it, and get a new build status without doing anything manually. 
* We also installed Docker on our Jenkins Agent and created a docker from a Dockerfile.
* Now let’s do a full CD release: integrate with DockerHub and upload our image to a registry.

## Tasks:
### Task 1
* A DockerHub account is required for this task. If you don't have one yet, please create it.
* Configure DockerHub credentials in Jenkins:
  * In your Jenkins left menu click on `Credentials` -> `System` -> `Global Credentials` -> `Add credentials`. 
    * Add your DockerHub username and password.
    * ID: `dockerhub.<your_dockerhub_username>`
    * Description: `Access to DockerHub (user: <your_dockerhub_username>)`

### Task 2
* Check with `Jenkins Pipeline Syntax Generator` how to run the command `withDockerRegistry`.
* Change the `devops-pipeline-run-docker` Jenkins job to a Docker image with your own DockerHub registry.
* Add to `devops-pipeline-run-docker` Jenkins job the `withDockerRegistry` command, and inside it:
  * `customImage.push()`
* Run the build and make sure that the new Docker was pushed to your DockerHub.
* Send me your Jenkins pipeline code, and the output of your Jenkins job.

### Task 3
* Install the following plugins:
  * `Build Monitor View`.
  * `BlueOcean Aggregator`.
  * `Slack Notification`.
